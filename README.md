##  Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
curl -o MorphusInstaller.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lynette-Pinto/Advanced-File-Transfer-and-Data-Processing-System/main/MorphusInstaller.sh
cd <script_location>
chmod +x MorphusInstaller.sh
```

### 2. Run the Installer

```bash
Mac OS:
sh MorphusInstaller.sh

Linux OS:
./MorphusInstaller.sh
```

You will be prompted for:

- Confirmation of Docker availability 
- Port numbers (UI, Backend DB)
- MySQL database setup (New or Existing)
    - Existing Database (Hostname, Port, Username, Password)
- Docker Compose validation
  
Note: If you choose to use an existing database, the application will attempt to connect using the provided details. It will automatically create a database named morphus if it does not already exist.

### 4. Version

```bash
morphus version
```

You can check the current version of Morphus Data that is installed on the system using this command.

---

### 3. Start the Service

```bash
morphus start
```

During the first launch, you'll be asked to:

1. Enter your organization’s domain name
2. Confirm it 
3. Provide your first name, last name, and company email
4. A user account is created with default password: `Welcome@123`

##  CLI Utility

After installation, a global CLI command `morphus` is registered with the following subcommands:

```bash
morphus version     # Dislays the current version
morphus start       # Launch containers
morphus stop        # Stop containers
morphus update      # Upgrade to another version
morphus rollback    # Rollsback to the previous version
morphus uninstall   # Remove all containers and files
```
---

##  Updating to a Newer Version

```bash
morphus update
```

- Fetches laatest version from GitHub
- Updates `.env`
- Restarts containers with new version

---
##  Rollback to a Previous Version

```bash
morphus rollback
```

- Rolls back the application to the most recent previously installed version.
- Rollback is limited to only one version back (cannot revert to older versions beyond the immediate last one).
- Automatically restarts all containers using the rolled-back version.
** Note: Any changes made before rollback will be lost after rollback
